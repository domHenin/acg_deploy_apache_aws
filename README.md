# Using Terraform to Create an Environment

## Overview

Using Provisioner uses [terraform] to create an apache virtual
machines on [AWS Cloud]. The [terraform] job expects
variables set as environment variables or in a `terraform.tfvars` file.


**NOTE**: [Terraform][tfhome] must be version 0.12 or greater.

## Getting Started

### How Terraform Stores Current State

[Terraform][tfhome] stores cluster state data in
`.terraform/terraform.tfstate` by default. Configuring the `prefix` and
`bucket` variables will enable storage in a remote bucket instead and is
useful for sharing state among multiple administrators. The following
resources provide some useful background information.
